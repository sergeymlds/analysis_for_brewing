# Exploratory data analysis of brewing production
Brewing production has its own standards to be followed. The main problem is to  maintain  the standards,  taking into account the variation of the parameters of the raw material. There are two main parameters that must be followed according to the brewing recipe. These parameters are pH and color of the beerwort, which are controlled by Phosphoric acid and burn malt respectively. The purpose of this study is to determine how other brewing parameters affect the pH and the color, and which parameters have the main influence/impact.
